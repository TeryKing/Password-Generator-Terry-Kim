# Password Generator Terry Kim
Password Generator by Terry Kim

Creating a script to prompt user to generate a randomized password.

In order the window prompt will declare:

- Length of the password with min 8 and max 128.

- If user wants capitalized letters for the randomized password.

- If user wants lower cased letters for the randomized password.

- If user wants special characters for the randomized password.

- If user wants numbers for the randomized password.

The first prompt will have a limit of minimum 8 characters and maximum 128 character, otherwise the prompt will declare invalid and ask to try again.

The remaining prompt will only take yes or no inputs.

If previous steps were properly completed, the password should result with user inputs.
